Available Data

Fleet Telemetry provides multiple types of data which reflect the realtime state of the vehicle.

Vehicle Data

Vehicle data is sent every 500 milliseconds. The vehicles behavior for sending data is described in System Behavior.

A protobuf definition file of these fields is available in the fleet-telemetry Github repo.

There are cases where a datum will return a value of invalid: true instead of an expected data type. This means the vehicle has entered a state where that signal cannot be accurately measured or is otherwise invalid.
